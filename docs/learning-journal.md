## How to Use
- Add entries chronologically, with the most recent at the top.
- Include the date and your name/identifier for each entry.
- Be concise but include enough detail to be useful for future reference.
- Feel free to include code snippets, links to relevant resources, or references to specific commits or pull requests.
